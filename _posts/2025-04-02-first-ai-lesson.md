# ðŸ“˜ AI Learning Blog â€“ fastai Course Documentation

Welcome to my __personal learning blog__ where I document my journey through the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/). I created this blog using GitHub Pages with the [fast_template](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html) as the foundation.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing**: First, I learned the basics of running deep learning on a PC with dev containers. I utilised [brian's](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/10/02/BYODImage.html) to get started, first creating a model trained to detect if an image was of a bird or not.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make this blog post and pages by creating new `.md` files and placing them in the `/_posts/` folder. This was made by following the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html) guide.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish reading through the fast AI course and complete my assignment, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
