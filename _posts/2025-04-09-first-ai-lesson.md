# ðŸ“˜ AI Learning Blog â€“ fastai Course Documentation

Welcome to my __personal learning blog__ where I document my journey through the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/). I created this blog using GitHub Pages with the [fast_template](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html) as the foundation.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
